## Description
This is a children's game made with Unity (C# Scripts) with the purpose of educating kids on racism and other systematic injustices. Children are not born racist, they are taught to be racist. Therefore, this game attempts to change these perceptions for the better by teaching kids at a young age that everyone is equal, regardless of race, gender, ethenicity, etc.
